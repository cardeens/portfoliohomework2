Unit 2 CSS &amp; Bootstrap HW: Responsive Portfolio

## Description
The deliverable for this project is a first pass at a portfolio that will ultimately be used to house our projects that we will complete during this program, and any others in the future. This web-based portfolio has three key pages, all of which are mobile-responsive to ensure a great user experience across any device:

* About me page
* Portfolio
* Contact form

I created this website primarily by utilizing Bootstrap templates. This gave me the ability to simply access templates for elements such as the navigation bar (navbar), contact form, and cards to build out my three pages. I also made sure that all the pages and elements would be mobile responsive by using Bootstrap’s grid system and documentation for elements like the navbar hamburger menu. Lastly, I added a CSS style sheet to personalize the website with unique colors and fonts.
This is an important resource for developers to have as it is the way we can show off the work we’ve done and the skills we’ve learned to make us competitive to future employers. During the course of the program, I will continue to build out this website and add my projects to the Portfolio page so that I can market myself and the skills I am learning.

## Installation 
Now that you have access to the project repo, use the git clone command in your terminal to clone the resources onto your local device. Afterwards, open the directory in your code editor to access the index.html and style.css files. You can also view the final product by clicking the website URL provided by Git.

## Usage
In the directory, you will find four files:

* index.html: the About Me page of the website that also serves as the homepage
* portfolio.html: this contains the code for the Portfolio page, where the main content will be stored once available. At the moment all of the cards have placeholder content
* contact.html: this page contains the contact form, which currently is not active or able to collect information
* style.css: this file contains the CSS properties that help format the pages in the web portfolio

Lastly, there is only one image, which is a headshot for the about me page.

## Tests
To test, open any of the files in your browser. You will first be taken to that files’ page, but you can navigate to the other pages in the navbar. The expected outcomes are:

* Clicking the page options in your navbar should take you to the respective page in the website 
* Contact form will NOT work when pressing submit, and will not collect information at this time
* When viewing the website on a mobile device or smaller viewport, the page options in the navbar will collapse into a hamburger menu. The cards in the portfolio and content in the about me section should also stack
