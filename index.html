          <p>My full name is Jordan Jayson Cardenas, though most know me by JJ. In 1994, I was born just outside of Denver, CO where most of my family was based. Shortly after my sister was born, we moved out to the Bay Area where my mom began her career in technology. At nine years old, we moved to the Seattle area when my mom accepted a job a Microsoftâ€™s main campus. Her work in the tech space would prove to shape my professional interest and endeavors beginning in college, when I studied marketing at Seattle University.</p>
          <p>
          After graduating in 2015, I began my first full-time job as an account executive at a staffing and professional services firm, where I managed our high-tech accounts such as Microsoft and Facebook. Shortly after, I started as a marketing specialist at Xevo, which at the time was a small tech startup by the name of UIEvolution. During my time at the company we rebranded, brought an innovative new connected-car solution to market, scored partnerships with major automakers such as General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler Automotive, and were ultimately acquired by Lear Corporation. After almost four years of growing my marketing skills and technical knowledge with the company, I moved to a marketing strategy consulting firm named Lenati where I worked on several high-visibility marketing projects within the Microsoft account.</p>
          <p>
          During my time at Lenati I decided to pivot my career and began learning how to code. I enrolled in a certificate program at the University of Washington for full-stack development. During my time at the program I learned the key fundamentals to becoming a web developer and built experience working with several programming languages.</p>
          <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy working with music and recently learned how to be a sound engineer at a Seattle-based recording studio. I hope to continue building these skills to help musicians bring their work to life. I am also an avid fan of the Seahawks and Sounders, and love to spend time with family and friends whenever I can. </p>
